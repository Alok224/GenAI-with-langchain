During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products.

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders. Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands.

Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen. The Lead India 2020 Found ation \\ncreated by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad is training thousands of s tudents in many \\ndistricts of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the District Adm inistration.

During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam reflects on his five-year tenure at Rashtrapati Bhavan, expressing gratitude to the diverse individuals he has interacted with. He highlights 10 key messages he has learned during his interactions, including the importance of accelerating development, empowering villages, and mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness. He also shares a personal anecdote about a young girl's question about India's potential to become a developed nation by 2020, which he assures her is a goal worth striving for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a concise summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation, where they would work to make it a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and mobilizing rural competence to achieve a developed India by 2020. The speaker highlights the need to connect villages with each other and with urban societies, citing a positive experience in Nagaland. The speech also mentions an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has created a PURA complex involving 65 villages, providing physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic development, employment generation, and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has transformed 200 acres of wasteland into a cultivable land. With the support of 1000 self-help groups, villagers are now engaged in various activities such as cultivation, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing. The project has also enabled the development of internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative ability of the villagers. The speaker emphasizes the potential of similar projects to bridge the rural-urban divide and suggests that the country needs around 7000 such PURA projects to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences that have given them confidence in the nation's agricultural future. Firstly, they met over 6,000 farmers at Rashtrapati Bhavan, who showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasized the need to double agricultural production while reducing land, water, and manpower, and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They also expressed confidence that the partnership of farmers, agricultural scientists, and industries can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the speaker recounts a beautiful experience with a wheelchair-bound individual, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who had no hands or legs but a radiant smile. Despite his physical limitations, he was confident and expressed gratitude to God and others for giving him confidence, training, and help. The speaker was moved by his positivity and asked what he could do for him; Krishna Murthy replied that he would like to sing in front of the speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring stories. First, it shares the story of a physically challenged individual who, despite his limitations, developed a talent for music with the support of his parents, teachers, and others. He goes on to perform at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre, showcasing his merit. Second, the speech recounts the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by the 2005 earthquake. Despite the devastation, the villagers, with the help of the Army, Air Force, and state government, came together to overcome their challenges and rebuild their community. The speech emphasizes the importance of partnership and perseverance in overcoming adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the courage and resilience of children and villagers in the face of natural disasters. The speaker shares their experiences of visiting villages affected by earthquakes and tsunamis, where they witnessed people coming together to rebuild and support each other. The speaker also shares a personal story of visiting the Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they met tribal council leaders and children who had taken in affected victims as their own, showing remarkable courage and solidarity. The speech concludes by emphasizing the importance of connectivity and societal transformation in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of the Pan African e-Network, a project to connect 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers in Africa, with a pilot project already underway in Ethiopia.\n",
      "\n",
